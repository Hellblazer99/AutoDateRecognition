# AutoDateRecognition
Different datasets use different formats to represent dates [`DD-MM-YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD` or explicitly stated like `30 oct 1986`, `thursday october 6 2011`]. Here I have used an LSTM to learn various representation of dates and it is used to convert dates from datasets to a specific format `DD-MM-YYYY`. 

`AutoDateTagging.ipynb` contains the implementation of the project. It was done on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G2KWLhzUEqg4JdfgjxUSAMsZM01cO4qf?usp=sharing).
